# Assignment 4 - Bootstrap Layout

Assignment 4 is a single, responsive page built using the Bootstrap framework. All CSS styling will be done using Bootstrap’s pre-written classes and no custom or external CSS will be needed.

Screenshots and images are provided in the assets folder. The completed site must demonstrate well-formed and structured HTML markup while utilizing Bootstrap’s CSS classes. The layout and styles will best match the screenshots and adjust to different screen sizes using Bootstrap’s grid system and predefined breakpoints.

Other Bootstrap components such as a responsive navbar, carousel, icons, cards, and a form will be required. As this is not a customized PSD design, do your best to mimic spacing and text styling by using the utility classes available in the framework.

Following the steps of a build methodology:

1. Create a standard framework folder and an HTML page that brings in Bootstrap’s CSS and JS via CDN. There will be no external CSS files or folder. 

2. Markup the content using semantic and well-structured HTML. Use proper form structure and input types.

3. Use the grid system along with container classes to layout the content to match the screenshots. Starting with the mobile first layout, match the layout for each width using the class infixes for the available breakpoints.

4. Refer to Bootstrap’s documentation page for examples of how to structure certain components required in the build. https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/

5. Optimize and compress image files.

6. Validate the markup and fix any errors.

7. Run a Google Lighthouse audit for both the mobile and desktop layout.Make any necessary adjustments to improve the performance, accessibly, best practice, and SEO scores. Talk to your instructor if you are unsure about the scoring. **note: a framework with over 10,000 lines of CSS will unused CSS that could hurt the performance score. 

Things to note regarding styling:

- The header element is ‘sticky’ and stays at the top of the screen when scrolling.
- The navigation is fully responsive and expands at the large breakpoint.
- The navigation links can link to the different sections on the page, however, that is optional.
- Both the toggle navigation and the carousel require Bootstrap’s JavaScript library.
- The typography sizing are the default sizes defined within the framework.
- All of the colours used come from the framework.
- The SVGs come from the icon library within Bootstrap. Increase their size to match the heading size (2em).
- Additional CSS is not needed and should be avoided.
